Human genome fasta: https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_42/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz
Appended HEK sequences: http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/downloads/genomeview/hek293/supplementary/plasmid/
Due to size, the HEK genome used is not linked here, but the human fasta and added HEK sequences used are available above. All other reference genomes are available here in associated folders.
